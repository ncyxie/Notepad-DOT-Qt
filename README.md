## FAQ

1. **Can I "kang" a little of this Notepad code?**

For sure. This is why it is open-source. Do not hesitate, make it better. :)

2. **Does this Notepad run on Windows and Linux?**

Yes, it does. If you are Windows user, make sure you download the '.exe' file and setup the application. 
If you are Linux user, download the '.AppImage' file and allow it to execute.

3. **What are this Notepad operating system requirements?**

**For Windows operating systems:**
* Minimum: Windows 7 SP1;
* **Recommended: Windows 10 21H1 *(or Windows 11 Insider build);***

* **Architecture: x86_64.**

**For Linux operating systems:**
* Minimum: Any Linux Distribution with glibc version 2.27 and higher (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and higher);
* **Recommended: Any Linux Distribution with glibc version 2.33 (e.g. Ubuntu 21.04);**

* **Architecture: x86_64.**

If your OS meets the requirements *(or if doesn't)* and Notepad DOT Qt doesn't work properly, make sure your 
operating system is up to date.
	
4. **How to check my Linux distribution glibc version?**
	
It's very simple. Open up terminal and enter this command-line: ``ldd --version``.

5. **Why Notepad DOT Qt doesn't officially support macOS?**

I don't have macOS computer, so I cannot test for bugs, how it works and etc. 
Actually, Notepad DOT Qt *might* work on macOS, but you will have to compile and test application
yourself.
